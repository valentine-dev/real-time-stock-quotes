<h1>Monthly DRIP with Discount in Canada <a href="mailto:donations@enjoyit.ca">&#128151; Donations</a></h1>
<p>
  Is there a public company that:
  <ul>
    <li>delivers cash dividend EACH month AND </li>
    <li>has Dividend Re-Investment Plan (“DRIP”) AND</li>
    <li>has a discount rate applicable to its DRIP?</li>
  </ul>
    Luckily, I find such a company: Northland Power at <a href="https://www.northlandpower.com/">https://www.northlandpower.com/</a>!
</p>
 <p>Northland Power annual common share dividend is currently $1.20, paid at the rate of $0.10 per month with discount rate applicable to its Dividend Re-Investment Plan (“DRIP”) from 0% to 3%.
 </p>
  
  <p>Enjoy it!</p>
