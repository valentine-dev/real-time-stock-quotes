<h1>Monthly DRIP with Discount in Canada <a href="mailto:donations@enjoyit.ca">&#128151; Donations</a></h1>
<p>
  Is there a public company in Canada that has all of the following?
  <ul>
    <li>&#x1FE0F; cash dividend EACH month</li>
    <li>&#x1FE0F; Dividend Re-Investment Plan (“DRIP”)</li>
    <li>&#x1FE0F; a discount rate applicable to its DRIP</li>
  </ul>
    Luckily, I find such a company: Northland Power at <a href="https://www.northlandpower.com/">https://www.northlandpower.com/</a>!
</p>
 <p>Northland Power common share dividend is currently paid $0.10 monthly with discount rate applicable to its Dividend Re-Investment Plan (“DRIP”) from 0% to 3%.
 </p>
  
  <p>Enjoy it!</p>
